            "Most people write business plans to attract investors, and while this is necessary to raise money, \
            most venture capitalists have made a “gut level” go/no go decision during the PowerPoint pitch. \
            Receiving (and possibly reading) the business plan is a mechanical step in due diligence. \
            The more relevant and important reason to write is a business plan, whether you are raising money \
            or not, is to force the management team to solidify the objectives (what), strategies (how), and \
            tactics (when, where, who). Even if you have all the capital in the world, you should still write a \
            business plan. Indeed, especially if you have all the capital in the world because too much capital \
            is worse than too little.",

            the company, the actual writing of the business plan- literally sitting down at a computer and pounding \
            out the document - should be a solo effort.And ideally the CEO should do it because she will need to know \
            the plan by heart.Take it from an author, for writing to be cogent and consistent, there needs to be only \
            one author.It's very difficult to cut-copy-and-paste several people's sections and come out with a good plan.",

            PowerPoint pitch from it. Is it any wonder why that the plans are lousy when they are based on crappy pitches? \
            The correct sequence is to perfect a pitch (10/20/30), and then write the plan from it. Write this down: A good \
            business plan is an elaboration of a good pitch; a good pitch is not the distillation of good business plan. Why? \
            Because it's much easier to revise a pitch than to revise a plan. Give the pitch a few times, see what works and \
            what doesn't, change the pitch, and then write the plan. Think of your pitch as your outline, and your plan as the \
            full text. How many people write the full text and then write the outline?",

            Conclusion (1). Essentially, this is the same list of topics as a PowerPoint pitch. Those numbers in parenthesis are the \
            ideal lengths for each section; note that they add up to eleven. As you'll see in a few paragraphs, the ideal length of a \

            business model, and why your product is curve jumping, paradigm shifting, and revolutionary. You should spend eighty \
            percent of your effort on writing a great executive summary. Most people spend eighty percent of their effort on crafty a \

            business plans, less is more. Many people believe that the purpose of a business plan is to create such shock and awe that \
            investors are begging for wiring instructions; the reality is that the purpose of a a business plan is to get to the next step: \
            continued due diligence with activities such as checking personal and customer references. The tighter the thinking, the shorter \

            nteresting, but not so large as to render urine drug-testing unnecessary. Do everyone a favor: Reduce your Excel hallucinations \
            to one page and provide a forecast of the key metrics of your business for example, the number of paying customers. These key \
            metrics provide insight into your assumptions. For example, if you're assuming that you'll get twenty percent of the Fortune 500 \

            adhere to the plan in the face of new information and new opportunities. As you execute the plan, you act emergent that is, you are \
            flexible and fast moving: changing as you learn more and more about the market. The plan, after all, should not take on a life of its own.",
